# StudentManager
This is the first application I ever made. It was meant to be a means for the BAS director at Renton Technical College to be able to
store and retrieve data about current and prospective students.

It's pretty embarassing to look back at this project and see all of the things I should have done differently.
There are menu's to add employers, schools and job titles of students, but they're buried within the context
of a student.
There are buttons in odd locations that don't signal to the user exactly what they're for.
Selecting students is done via combo box, making it very hard to allow for growth past 20-30 students.
There are places a user can double click a students data to get enhanced data, but it isn't made clear to the user.

Overall there are many things I should have done differently in this application. But it was pretty exciting to build at the time
and I've certainly learned a lot from it.
